Problem: 

User is interested in discovering most recent X number of album releases with a certain “Style” value  
However, newalbumreleases.net does not have filter by album release properties such as “Style” (Genre), “Format”, “Artist”...


Solution:

Web Crawler and Scraper that Crawls Y number of pages, extract and return albums with a certain “Style” value until X such albums are scraped/extracted
